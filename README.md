# LTE Shield
The LTE Shield is a low-power 4G LTE CAT-M1 shield that supports the new LTE CAT-M1 technology and integrates GNSS (GPS,GLONASS and BeiDou/Compass, Galileo, QZSS standards) for location tracking. Simply plug the shield into an Arduino, attach a LiPo battery to power the cellular module, insert a compatible SIM card, attach the LTE/GNSS antenna, and you're good to go!

## What is LTE CAT-M1 and NB-IoT?
LTE CAT-M1 is considered the second-generation LTE technology and is lower-power and more suitable for IoT devices. NarrowBand IoT (NB-IoT) or "CAT-M2" technology is a Low-Power Wide Area Network (LPWAN) technology specifically designed for low-power IoT devices. It is a relatively new technology that is, unfortunately, not yet available in the US, although there are rumors that certain large companies like AT&T are working on testing and building the infrastructure. For IoT devices using radio technology (RF) there are several things to keep in mind:

- Power consumption
- Bandwidth
- Range
- Packet size (send lots of data
- Cost

Each of these have tradeoffs (and I won't really explain them all); for example, large bandwidth allows devices to send lots of data (like your phone, which can stream YouTube!) but this also means it's very power-hungry. Increasing the range (the "area" of the network) also increase power consumption. In the case of NB-IoT, cutting down the bandwidth means that you won't be able to send much data, but for IoT devices shooting morsels of data to the cloud this is perfect! Hence, "narrow"-band technology, ideal for low-power devices with little amounts of data but still with long range (wide area)!

## Shield Versions
There are a few variants of the LTE Shield, so make sure you choose carefully!
