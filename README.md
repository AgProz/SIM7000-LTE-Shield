## Overview
The LTE Shield uses SIMCOM's SIM7000-series LTE modules which are low-power 4G LTE modules that support the new LTE CAT-M technology and also have integrated GNSS (GPS,GLONASS and BeiDou/Compass, Galileo, QZSS standards) for location tracking. NB-IoT is achieved with the different versions, namely the SIM7000E, SIM7000C, and SIM7000E-N modules. To use the LTE Shield, simply plug the shield into an Arduino, attach a LiPo battery to power the cellular module, insert a compatible SIM card, attach the LTE/GNSS antenna, and you're good to go!
